Do you recall composite functions such as $f \circ g(x)$?

Now we have $f \circ g \circ h (x)$ or `round(mean(c(4, 8, 16)))`

.font50[Subsetting data frames]

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
lapd <- read_csv(here::here("slides/data/Police_Payroll.csv")) 
```


```{r}
glimpse(lapd)

---

Before we work with this data it is a good idea to change variable names to tidy style.

```{r}

lapd <- clean_names(lapd)
glimpse(lapd)
```

class: middle 

## subsetting variables/columns

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-wrangle.001.jpeg")
```

--

`select()`

---

class: middle 

## subsetting observations/rows

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-wrangle.002.jpeg")
```

`slice()` and `filter()` 

---

`select` is used to select certain variables in the data frame. 


.left-panel[
```{r}
select(lapd, year, base_pay)
```
]

--

.right-panel[

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  select(year, base_pay)
```

]

---

`select` can also be used to drop certain variables if used with a negative sign.

```{r}
select(lapd, -row_id, -department_title)
```

---

class: middle 

## Selection helpers

`starts_with()`  
`ends_with()`  
`contains()`  

---

```{r}
select(lapd, starts_with("q"))
```

```{r}
select(lapd, ends_with("pay"))
```

---

```{r}
select(lapd, contains("pay"))

`slice()` subsetting rows based on a row number.

The data below include all the rows from third to seventh. Including third and seventh.

```{r}

`filter()` subsetting rows based on a condition.

Q. According to [datausa.io](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/los-angeles-ca#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20CA,%2462%2C474%2C%20a%203.78%25%20increase.) Los Angeles had a median household income of $62474 in 2018. How many LAPD staff members had a base pay higher than $62474 in year 2018 according to this data?

.footnote[Median household income is **not** the same thing as median employee income. Our aim is data wrangling and not necessarily statistical analysis for now.]

---

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(year == 2018 & base_pay > 62474)
```

Q. How many LAPD staff were employed full time in 2018?



```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(employment_type == "Full Time" & year == 2018) %>% 
  nrow()
```

---
class: middle

We have done all sorts of selections, slicing, filtering on `lapd` but it has not changed at all. Why do you think so?

```{r}
glimpse(lapd)
```

---

class: middle

Moving forward we are only going to focus on year 2018, and use `job_class_title`, `employment_type`, and `base_pay`. Let's clean our data accordingly and move on with the smaller `lapd` data that we need.

---

class: middle

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(year == 2018) %>% 
  select(job_class_title, 
         employment_type, 
         base_pay)
```

---

class: middle

```{r}
lapd <- 
  lapd %>% 
  filter(year == 2018) %>% 
  select(job_class_title, 
         employment_type, 
         base_pay)
```


---

class: middle

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
lapd <- read_csv(here::here("slides/data/Police_Payroll.csv")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(year == 2018) %>% 
  select(job_class_title, 
         employment_type, 
         base_pay)
```



```{r}
glimpse(lapd)
```

**Goal**: 

Create a new variable called `base_pay_k` that represents `base_pay` in thousand dollars.

---

class: middle

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  mutate(base_pay_k = base_pay/1000)
```

---

class: middle

```{r}
glimpse(lapd)
```

**Goal**: 

Create a new variable called `base_pay_level` which has `Less Than 0`, `No Income`, `Less than Median and Greater than 0` and `Greater than Median`. We will consider $62474 as the median (from previous lecture).

---

class: middle

Let's first check to see there is anyone earning exactly the median value.

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(base_pay == 62474)
```

---

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  mutate(base_pay_level = case_when(
    base_pay < 0 ~ "Less than 0", 
    base_pay == 0 ~ "No Income",
    base_pay < 62474 & base_pay > 0 ~ "Less than Median, Greater than 0",
    base_pay > 62474 ~ "Greater than Median")) 
```

---


```{r}
lapd %>% 
  mutate(base_pay_level = case_when(
    base_pay < 0 ~ "Less than 0", 
    base_pay == 0 ~ "No Income",
    base_pay < 62474 & base_pay > 0 ~ "Less than Median, Greater than 0",
    base_pay > 62474 ~ "Greater than Median")) %>% 
  select(base_pay_level)
```


---

We can use pipes with ggplot too! 

.left-panel[
```{r eval = FALSE}
lapd %>% 
  mutate(base_pay_level = case_when(
    base_pay < 0 ~ "Less than 0", 
    base_pay == 0 ~ "No Income",
    base_pay < 62474 & base_pay > 0 ~ "Less than Median, Greater than 0",
    base_pay > 62474 ~ "Greater than Median")) %>% 
  select(base_pay_level) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = base_pay_level)) +
  geom_bar()
```
]

.right-panel[
```{r echo = FALSE}
lapd %>% 
  mutate(base_pay_level = case_when(
    base_pay < 0 ~ "Less than 0", 
    base_pay == 0 ~ "No Income",
    base_pay < 62474 & base_pay > 0 ~ "Less than Median, Greater than 0",
    base_pay > 62474 ~ "Greater than Median")) %>% 
  select(base_pay_level) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = base_pay_level)) +
  geom_bar()
```
]

---

class: middle

```{r}
glimpse(lapd)
```

**Goal**: 

Make `job_class_title` and `employment_type` factor variables. 


---

class: middle

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  mutate(employment_type = as.factor(employment_type),
         job_class_title = as.factor(job_class_title)) 
```

---

class: middle

`as.factor()` - makes a vector factor  
`as.numeric()` - makes a vector numeric  
`as.integer()` - makes a vector integer  
`as.double()` - makes a vector double  
`as.character()` - makes a vector character  

---

class: middle

Once again we did not "save"
anything into `lapd`. As we work on data cleaning it makes sense not to "save" the data frames. Once we see the final data frame we want then we can "save" (i.e. overwrite) it.

---

In your lecture notes, you can do all the changes in this lecture in one long set of piped code. That's the beauty of piping!

```{r eval = FALSE}
lapd <- 
  lapd %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(year == 2018) %>% 
  select(job_class_title, 
         employment_type, 
         base_pay) %>% 
    mutate(employment_type = as.factor(employment_type),
           job_class_title = as.factor(job_class_title),
           base_pay_level = case_when(
             base_pay < 0 ~ "Less than 0", 
             base_pay == 0 ~ "No Income",
             base_pay < 62474 & base_pay > 0 ~ "Less than Median, Greater than 0",
             base_pay > 62474 ~ "Greater than Median")) 
```

---

class: middle

## Word of caution

The functions `clean_names()`, `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()` all take a data frame as the first argument. Even though we do not see it, the data frame is piped through from the previous step of code at each step. 
When we use these functions without the `%>%` we have to include the data frame explicitly.


.pull-left[
Data frame is used as the first argument
```{r}
clean_names(lapd)
```
]

.pull-right[
Data frame is piped

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  clean_names()
```

```

```{r echo = FALSE}
q1 <- summarize(lapd, quantiles = quantile(base_pay, c(0.25))) %>% 
  pull()
```

---

class: middle

We can use multiple functions such as `mean()` and `median` within the summarize function.

```{r}
summarize(lapd,
          mean(base_pay),
          median(base_pay))
```

---

class: middle 

In order to display the variable names more legibly in the output, we can assign variable names to numerical summaries (e.g. `mean_base_pay`).

```{r}
summarize(lapd,
          mean_base_pay = mean(base_pay),
          med_base_pay = median(base_pay))
```

---

class: middle

Some tther useful functions that `summarize()` can handle are:

`min()`  
`max()`  
`sd()`  
`var()`

`group_by()`

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}

`group_by()` separates the data frame by the groups. Any action following `group_by()` will be completed for each group separately.

  group_by(employment_type) %>% 
  summarize(med_base_pay = median(base_pay))
```

---

class: middle

We can also remind ourselves how many staff members there were in each group.

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  group_by(employment_type) %>% 
  summarize(med_base_pay = median(base_pay),
            count = n())
```

Note that `n()` does not take any arguments.
